This report keeps maintainability risk visible before the Meta Skill grows more gates, renderers, and CLI commands.

## Hotspots

No file-size hotspots found.

## Watchlist

No near-threshold files found.

## Early Watchlist

No early watch files found.

## Largest Files

| File | Lines | Kind | Severity |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| `scripts/docforge_project.py` | `36` | `cli-script` | `pass` |

## Release Rule

- `block` hotspots should be split before governed release.
- `warn` hotspots can ship only when Review Studio keeps them visible and a reviewer accepts the modularization plan.
- Do not split a file only for line count; split when a stable responsibility boundary is clear.
