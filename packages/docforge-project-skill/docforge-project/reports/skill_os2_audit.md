## Audit Items

| Area | Status | Current | Target | Next action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Skill IR | missing | schema 2.0.0; targets 5 | 2.0 schema, root export, and target-neutral contract evidence | Keep IR as the source before target packaging. |
| Target Compiler | pass | 5/5 targets pass | OpenAI, Claude, generic, Agent Skills compatible, and VS Code contracts generated from IR | Deepen target-native transforms when provider clients expose stronger runtime APIs. |
| Output Eval Lab | pass | 6 cases; delta 100.0; exec 12; blind 6 | with-skill/baseline, assertions, execution evidence, blind A/B, failure taxonomy | Add more real-file and adversarial holdout cases as usage grows. |
| Provider Holdout | external-required | phase1 model-executed 0/40; calls 0/40; status missing evidence | The fixed DeepSeek Flash+Pro matrix completes 40 real calls within the governed token and timeout budgets | Run evidence-build with DEEPSEEK_API_KEY and keep raw outputs in the isolated run directory. |
| Human Adjudication | human-required | phase1 reviewers 0/3; pairs 0/20; promotion pending | Three controlled, independent blind reviews are bound to the same 20-pair pack before quality promotion | Collect three controlled reviewer packets and adjudicate them against the private run answer key. |
| Benchmark Reproducibility | missing | artifacts 25; missing 0; failures 4 | Public methodology, reproducible commands, required artifacts, and failure disclosure are machine-checkable | Keep the manifest current with every benchmark, package, and release evidence change. |
| Runtime Conformance | pass | 5/5 targets pass | Target package structure, metadata, relative paths, and degradation notes pass | Keep target conformance fixtures updated as platform contracts change. |
| Trust Security | pass | secrets 0; scripts 1; help failures 0 | Secrets, scripts, dependencies, permissions, and package hash are reviewable | Keep high-permission approvals scoped, expiring, and target-mapped. |
| Permission Metadata | pass | 4/4 target probes pass; metadata fallback 4; installer enforcement 4 | Packaged adapters expose explicit permission metadata, residual risks, and installer enforcement evidence when available | Preserve residual-risk notes until real native enforcement exists. |
| Native Permission Enforcement | external-required | native-enforced targets 0; installer-enforced targets 4 | At least one target/client enforces approved permissions at runtime | Integrate a real target-client or external installer runtime guard before claiming native permission enforcement. |
| Skill Atlas | pass | 1 skills; actionable collisions 0 | Workspace catalog, route overlap, stale/owner gaps, drift, and no-route opportunities | Feed real drift data into Atlas once client telemetry is installed. |
| Registry Distribution | pass | zip entries 153; install failures 0; permission failures 0 | Package metadata, archive checksum, package verification, and install simulation pass | Regenerate registry after package verification so checksums stay aligned. |
| Review Studio | pass | decision review; warnings 6; score 84 | One page shows gates, evidence paths, blockers, warnings, actions, waivers, and annotations | Resolve human/external warning gates before claiming full release readiness. |
| Telemetry Drift | pass | events 0; risk no-data; recipes 5 | Local-first metadata-only event contract, aggregate drift report, hook recipes, and import path | Keep raw JSONL out of distributed packages and use aggregate reports for Atlas. |
| Native Client Telemetry | external-required | external source events 0; adoption samples 0 | A real Browser/Chrome/provider client sends production metadata events | Install a real client against the native host and import production metadata-only events. |

## Open Highest-Leverage Gaps

- `skill-ir` (missing): Keep IR as the source before target packaging.
- `provider-holdout` (external-required): Run evidence-build with DEEPSEEK_API_KEY and keep raw outputs in the isolated run directory.
- `human-adjudication` (human-required): Collect three controlled reviewer packets and adjudicate them against the private run answer key.
- `benchmark-reproducibility` (missing): Keep the manifest current with every benchmark, package, and release evidence change.
- `native-permission-enforcement` (external-required): Integrate a real target-client or external installer runtime guard before claiming native permission enforcement.
