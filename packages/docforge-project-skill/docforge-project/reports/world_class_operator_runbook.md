This runbook coordinates evidence collection only. It does not accept submissions or make world-class completion true.

## Fast Path

1. Run the real external or human work for one evidence item.
2. Generate the matching submission draft.
3. Replace template-only fields with aggregate evidence and provenance.
4. Validate intake, review the queue, refresh the ledger, then run the claim guard.

## Coordination Plan

| Step | Evidence | Owner | Needs user | User action | Assistant action | Command | Pass condition |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `prepare-evidence-session` | `all` | assistant + user | `true` | Confirm provider access, reviewer availability, target client path, and telemetry client path before collection starts. | Run preflight and prepare submission drafts without accepting them as evidence. | `python3 scripts/yao.py world-class-preflight . --submissions-dir evidence/world_class/submissions --self && python3 scripts/yao.py world-class-submission-kit . --output-dir evidence/world_class/submissions --prefill-artifacts --self` | Preflight lists the same pending evidence keys and no credential values are printed. |
| `collect-provider-holdout` | `provider-holdout` | assistant + operator with provider credentials | `true` | Provide DEEPSEEK_API_KEY through the environment for the fixed Flash+Pro matrix. | Run evidence-build, verify 40 governed calls and the private blind-review material boundary, then prepare the evidence packet. | `python3 scripts/yao.py evidence-build . --run-id <PROVIDER_RUN_ID> --self` | reports/provider_output_evaluation.json records 40/40 model calls, zero failures, and total_tokens <= 250000. |
| `collect-human-adjudication` | `human-adjudication` | human reviewer + assistant | `true` | Have reviewer-a, reviewer-b, and reviewer-c independently complete the same 20-pair role-neutral pack through controlled submissions. | Verify the three packet identities and commitments, then finalize the source provider run without rerunning the matrix. | `python3 scripts/yao.py evidence-finalize-review . --source-run <PROVIDER_RUN_ID> --decisions <A.json> --decisions <B.json> --decisions <C.json> --reviewer-registry <registry.json> --self` | reports/provider_output_adjudication.json has reviewer_count == 3, pair_count == 20, and failure_count == 0. |
| `collect-native-permission-enforcement` | `native-permission-enforcement` | target client or installer integrator + assistant | `true` | Select a real target client or external installer guard that can enforce declared capabilities instead of metadata-only fallback. | Run runtime permission probes, package verification, install simulation, and prepare the native enforcement evidence packet. | `python3 scripts/yao.py runtime-permissions . --package-dir dist --self` | reports/runtime_permission_probes.json has native_enforcement_count > 0 and failure_count == 0. |
| `collect-native-client-telemetry` | `native-client-telemetry` | real client integrator + assistant | `true` | Install the native host manifest in a real Browser, Chrome, IDE, or provider client and trigger a metadata-only event. | Generate native host assets, import the external event JSONL, refresh adoption drift, and prepare the telemetry evidence packet. | `python3 scripts/yao.py telemetry-import . --input-jsonl .yao/telemetry_spool/external_events.jsonl --source external --self` | reports/adoption_drift_report.json has source_types.external > 0 and adoption_sample_count > 0. |
| `review-and-release-gate` | `all` | assistant + ledger reviewer | `true` | Approve only validated evidence packets and confirm the release wording after the claim guard passes. | Run intake, submission review, ledger, claim guard, benchmark, evidence consistency, Review Studio, and CI before final publish. | `python3 scripts/yao.py world-class-intake . --submissions-dir evidence/world_class/submissions --self && python3 scripts/yao.py world-class-submission-review . --submissions-dir evidence/world_class/submissions --self && python3 scripts/yao.py world-class-ledger . --submissions-dir evidence/world_class/submissions --self && python3 scripts/yao.py world-class-claim-guard . --self && make ci-test` | Ledger ready_to_claim_world_class, benchmark public_claim_ready, claim guard violation_count == 0, Review Studio has no blockers, and CI passes. |

### Source Evidence Snapshot

| Check | Current | Expected | Status | Next action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| External events | `0` | `>0` | `blocked` | Import at least one metadata-only event from a real client. |
| Adoption sample | `0` | `>0` | `blocked` | Telemetry must include adoption outcome evidence. |
| Raw content blocked | `False` | `false` | `pass` | Telemetry must stay metadata-only. |

## Release Gate

- decision: `blocked-until-evidence-accepted`
- ready: `false`
- blocked checks: `5` / `5`
- counts as completion: `false`
- final manual check: Run make ci-test in a clean worktree and verify GitHub Actions before converting the PR out of Draft.

| Check | Current | Expected | Status | Artifact |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| World-class ledger ready | `evidence-pending` | `ready_to_claim_world_class == true` | `blocked` | `reports/world_class_evidence_ledger.json` |
| Claim guard clean | `violations 0; ledger ready False` | `violation_count == 0 and ledger_ready_to_claim_world_class == true` | `blocked` | `reports/world_class_claim_guard.json` |
| Benchmark public claim ready | `public_claim_ready False` | `public_claim_ready == true` | `blocked` | `reports/benchmark_reproducibility.json` |
| Review Studio clean | `blockers 0; warnings 6` | `blocker_count == 0 and warning_count == 0` | `blocked` | `reports/review-studio.json` |
| Evidence consistency clean | `evidence-drift-detected` | `decision == consistent and fail_count == 0` | `blocked` | `reports/evidence_consistency.json` |

## Boundary

- Planned work, draft packets, metadata fallback, pending human decisions, and local command runners do not count as completion.
- Valid intake means ready for submission review; ledger review still requires passing source evidence.
- The world-class ledger and claim guard remain the source of truth.
