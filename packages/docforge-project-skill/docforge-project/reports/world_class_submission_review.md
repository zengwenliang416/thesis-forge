#### Privacy Contract

- Do not commit provider credentials or environment dumps.
- The output execution report records output hashes and aggregate run metadata, not raw provider prompts.

#### Privacy Contract

- Reviewer packets contain choices, reasons, hashes, and controlled submission metadata without raw prompts or answer-key roles.

- reports/runtime_permission_probes.json summary.installer_enforcement_pass_count records local installer enforcement but does not replace native evidence
- reports/skill_os2_audit.json item native-permission-enforcement status becomes pass

#### Intake Errors

- No intake errors.

#### Privacy Contract

- Do not mark native_enforcement true for metadata-only fallbacks.
- Keep residual risks visible for targets that still rely on operator enforcement.

### Native Client Telemetry

- reports/adoption_drift_report.json summary.adoption_sample_count > 0
- reports/skill_os2_audit.json item native-client-telemetry status becomes pass

#### Intake Errors

- No intake errors.

#### Privacy Contract

- Telemetry must remain metadata-only and local-first.
- Do not package reports/telemetry_events.jsonl or any raw prompt, output, transcript, note, or message field.

## Boundary

- A valid submission packet is not accepted evidence by itself.
- Planned work, metadata fallback, pending human review, and local command-runner output still do not count.
- The world-class ledger remains the source of truth for `ready_to_claim_world_class`.
